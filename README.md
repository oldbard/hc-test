HC Test


The time it took me to finish the exercise:

1st hour:

Analyzed game / Draw plans.
Got Assets.
Created project.
Imported Assets.

2nd hour:

Set up Collision.
Uploaded basic functionality.

3rd hour:

Fixed / prepared character

4th hour:

Implemented Obstacles

5th hour:

Implemented UI. (Without the progress)

Started work on the AI and doc

	I stopped within the 5 given hours.

The parts which were difficult:

	The AI part was difficult because of the lack of time.
	The animations could have had proper and better transitions. Which I had a proper model ready for this.
	
The parts I could have done better and how:
	
	All the code is in Monobehaviours. The whole system could have been better planned to avoid things like that.
	The game per se is super simple. The lack of ready tools, assets and preparation certainly stopped me from implementing more obstacles.
	
What would you do if you could go a step further in this game:

	I had a WIP AI to save my inputs so I could play it by the AI player after. That was going to be my next step.
	The progress at the top of the screen was also in my TODO.
	I really wanted to implement the jumping obstacles. It would be nice to inject some force in the rigid bodys and see them fly.
	I also wanted to prepare something like 5 maps to show other variations with the current obstacles and new ones to be added.
	
What do you think:

	I think this is an interesting test. Though not a real life situation. As there should be more time to prepare assets and plan properly.
	
	Did not finish implementing the AI. There was no time.
	Did not finish the map progress.
